# Considerations
For quick setup on the PS you can use the linux image from [this project](https://www.hackster.io/AlbertaBeef/zuboard-building-the-foundational-designs-f114d5), there is a download link for the last image. If you want to compile your own linux flavor the first page has the appropiate description.

We use vivado2022.1
